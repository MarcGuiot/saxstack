Make generate xml and reading using sax easier and very efficient.
SaxStack is a Java library designed to help programmers make a simple and efficient use of XML SAX parsers, and also to help them generate XML streams.
Its main design driver is the modelling of the parsing/generation as a stack of XML node handlers, which let the programmers focus on one XML node at a time and end up with an clean and efficient design.
